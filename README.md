# This Project: "Trading App FastAPI Asyncio"


### The goal of this project is to create some kind of free training/supporting framework for a web trading
### asynchronous application on FastAPI using new popular technologies in the backend! I think it will be very useful
### both for training young developers who do not have the opportunity to pay for expensive courses, and for
### the first steps in the backend by the same developers.


#### This application uses the following technologies (accordingly, all of them can be touched and tested):

- [ ] asynchrony using the Asyncio library
- [ ] designing application architecture and RESTful API
- [ ] data validation and typing using Pydantic
- [ ] working with PostgreSql using asynchronous SQLAlchemy + Alembic for database migration
- [ ] registration and authorization of users using Fastapi-Users
- [ ] websockets for communicating with clients
- [ ] Redis for caching and as a message broker
- [ ] background tasks with Celery and Flower
- [ ] some HTML using the Jinjia 2 template engine
- [ ] writing tests using the Pytest framework
- [ ] we use Docker and Docker-Compose containers.
